A deep dive into state management using React and modern libraries like Redux and MobX. Understand the best practices and patterns.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document is structured with a series of nested elements. Here is a basic example of an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text on my first HTML page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of the Basic Structure

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>`: The root element that contains all other HTML elements.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the character set, viewport settings, and the title.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the webpage, such as text, images, and links.

## Common HTML Tags

### Headings

Headings are used to define the titles and subtitles on a webpage. HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, with `<h1>` being the highest level.

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<h3>Sub-subheading</h3>
```

### Paragraphs

Paragraphs are defined using the `<p>` tag. They are used to group blocks of text.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

### Links

Links are created using the `<a>` tag. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
```

### Images

Images are embedded using the `<img>` tag. The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image file, and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" />
```

### Lists

HTML supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

#### Unordered List

```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

#### Ordered List

```html
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
```

## Advanced HTML Elements

### Tables

Tables are used to display data in a tabular format. They are created using the `<table>` tag, along with `<tr>` for table rows, `<th>` for table headers, and `<td>` for table data cells.

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data 1</td>
    <td>Data 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

### Forms

Forms are used to collect user input. They are created using the `<form>` tag, along with various input elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>`.

```html
<form action="/submit" method="post">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Conclusion

HTML is the foundation of web development. By understanding and using HTML tags, you can create structured and well-formatted web pages. As you become more familiar with HTML, you can explore additional tags and attributes to enhance your web pages further.
